# my-punch-card
Punch card data of all my commits

## Wat?
I wanted to see roughly how many hours of _work_ I had committed on Github, so I made this.

## How do I run it?
1. Grab yourself an [access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) from your Github account, the permissions you need are: `repo` and `user`
1. Pull this down and run `npm i`
1. Run it using `node index.js [your-github-username] [your-github-access-token]`
1. Sit and wait
